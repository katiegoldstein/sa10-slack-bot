# What is @katiehungry???
- my sassy tweenage bot <3 that gives you restaraunt recs <3
- wakes up on @katiehungry katiehungry

# What did work
- most of this! :)
- it was super easy to build / really cool to see how something like Whisperbot could be built!!

# What didn't work
- outgoing webhook was a BEAR to find (https://cs52-dartmouth.slack.com/apps/A0F7VRG6Q-outgoing-webhooks?next_id=0 for those interested)
- images from yelp don't parse through - oh well, you gotta go to the restaurant to see the food! Or click the yelp link!
- for some reason Sushi is very difficult to get through to Yelp - search for Italian instead lol
